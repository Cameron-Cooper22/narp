# narp
## Description
This is a daemon that effectively integrates nmap and arpwatch functionality. It is mainly created in order to further develop the arp-monitor
OPNsense plugin, however I likely plan on branching this out to go into Linux as well. But not windows. I will remain anti-bloatware till the
end of my days and have no plans to change.
