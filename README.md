# narp
## Description
This is a daemon that effectively integrates particular nmap and arpwatch functionality. It is a tool created in order to enhance the effectiveness of network monitoring through using SQLite and multi-threading. However, given the advances PostgreSQL has made, I will likely migrate over to that in the future for a more diverse toolset instead of the lightweight framework that SQLite provides.
